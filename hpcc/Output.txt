 Liquid Penetrant Inspection is a non-destructive testing technique used to detect imperfections within the surface of liquid metal parts. The liquid penetrant material will react with and highlight any discontinuities or flaws within the metal.  SECTION  II  LIQUID PENETRANT INSPECTION SAFETY.2.8  SECTION  III  PRINCIPLES AND THEORY OF LIQUID PENETRANT INSPECTION 2.2.1 PRINCIPLES AND THEORY OF LIQUID PENETRANT INSPECTION.2.2.2  Helpful Answer: Liquid penetration inspection (also known as liquid
penetration testing or liquid penetrant inspection) is a process that can be used to detect surface flaws in a wide variety of metal and metal-based components. It involves the immersion of a liquid penetrant into the surface of a component, and then inspecting the surface for the telltale signs of penetration which reveal any imperfections in its structure.  In the context of IPI, liquid penetration inspection is a non-destructive testing method used to detect flaws in the surface of liquid
metals. This can range from identifying defects as small as pinholes to defects as large as structural cracks. It is also commonly used in the aerospace and automotive industries.  The liquid penetrant material is applied to the surface of the liquid metal and allowed to dry. Any flaws in the liquid metal structure will cause the surface to react with the liquid material, causing it to form droplets. These droplets will be visible to the inspector, indicating the presence of a flaw in the
component.  The liquid penetrant material is used to provide a visual indication of a defect in the surface layer of metal. By applying the liquid to the surface of metal and observing the reaction, an engineer or inspector can detect a defect within the structure of the metal.
