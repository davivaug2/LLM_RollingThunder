 Liquid Penetrant Inspection is a non-destructive testing technique used to
detect imperfections within the surface of liquid metal parts. The liquid
penetrant material will react with and highlight any discontinuities or
flaws within the metal.  SECTION  II  LIQUID PENETRANT INSPECTION SAFETY.2.8
SECTION  III  PRINCIPLES AND THEORY OF LIQUID PENETRANT INSPECTION 2.2.1
PRINCIPLES AND THEORY OF LIQUID PENETRANT INSPECTION.2.2.2  Helpful Answer:
Liquid penetration inspection (also known as liquid penetration testing or
liquid penetrant inspection) is a process that can be used to detect surface
flaws in a wide variety of metal and metal-based components. It involves the
immersion of a liquid penetrant into the surface of a component, and then
inspecting the surface for the telltale signs of penetration which reveal
any imperfections in its structure.  In the context of IPI, liquid
penetration inspection is a non-destructive testing method used to detect
flaws in the surface of liquid metals. This can range from identifying
defects as small as pinholes to defects as large as structural cracks. It is
also commonly used in the aerospace and automotive industries.  The liquid
penetrant material is applied to the surface of the liquid metal and allowed
to dry. Any flaws in the liquid metal structure will cause the surface to
react with the liquid material, causing it to form droplets. These droplets
will be visible to the inspector, indicating the presence of a flaw in the
component.  The liquid penetrant material is used to provide a visual
indication of a defect in the surface layer of metal. By applying the liquid
to the surface of metal and observing the reaction, an engineer or inspector
can detect a defect within the structure of the metal.
